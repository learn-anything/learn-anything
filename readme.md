# Learn Anything

> App to share what you know or want to learn next. Together with ideas you want to build.

Explanation of vision and future [here](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/ideas/learn-anything).

## Develop

> to be edited, things are changing fast now

```
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

The tool to be built is a mix of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [Reflect](https://reflect.app/) (notes, wiki graph) and [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) (social link manager). And many more exciting ideas.

Need to get basics of notes + links covered.

Excited? Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/bxtD8x6aNF). Ask for help or share ideas about the project. This is a completely open source project / community with goals to in future create personalized study plans on any topic in the universe. As well as to be the best collaboration space for idea building.

Maybe with a mix of [Replit](https://replit.com). All open source. Your code. Your data. Your private or public knowledge/ideas.

## Structure

Built on top of [Solid Start](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start).

Using [Grafbase](https://grafbase.com) for backend.

Code structure is:

```
grafbase
 ├─ schema.graphql -- data model
app -- (Solid Start)
```

Website is to be deployed on: https://learn-anything.xyz

The version that is running in production now is old, from 2017.

Code here: https://github.com/learn-anything/2017-release

It has nice maps and 2000+ custom curated mind maps. Will be ported to LA eventually.

This current new vision of LA has been attempted to be written multiple times.

- In Next: https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/try/tree/main/archive/la-next
- In Solid Created JD App: https://github.com/learn-anything/solid

This is new one. As minimal as possible. Understandable and documented code.

See [Kuskus app](https://kuskus.app/) for now. LA will be worked on after KusKus app works well.
