- when to use `type` when to use `interface`
    - in theory `interface` is when you want to extend something, types are harder to extend?
    - what should default be? need to pick one and stick to it, annoying to have both `type` and `interface`..
    - current thinking is to default to `type` until it breaks down (then use interface)
