#### Organize world's knowledge, explore relations and curate learning paths

- **Learn**: Study guides created and improved by users
- **Explore**: Explore topics and their relationships
- **Build**: Share and find ideas to build

The [end goal](https://docs.learn-anything.xyz/roadmap) is to create a machine learning system that can craft personalized study plans for learning any topic and an open knowledge graph anyone can explore and extend.

As new version is being worked on. The code for old release (one currently deployed at [learn-anything.xyz](https://learn-anything.xyz)) can be found [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/2017-release).

New version is being worked on in private as we figure out how to make development work with open source contributions.

There are [docs](https://docs.learn-anything.xyz) available that describe the goals of the project as well as an open wiki of notes.

We also manage curation of [some lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#readme).
